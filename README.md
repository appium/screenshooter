ScreenShooter
=============

ScreenShooter is an open source screen shot application for Android that uses
Google's ddmlib and [Eclipse SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/).  Primarily made for [Appium](http://github.com/appium/appium)
but is standalone, and can be used in any project.

The code is licensed under the same license as much of the Android sdk; the
[Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).  Much of the code here is not unique and can be found in
any of a dozen other projects, but the intent is for it to do one thing, and
do it well.  Enjoy.
