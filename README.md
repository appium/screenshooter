ScreenShooter
=============

ScreenShooter is an open source screen shot application for android that uses
googles ddmlib and swt.  Primarily made for [Appium](http://github.com/appium/appium)
but is standalone, and should can be used in any project.

The code is licensed under the same license as much of the Android sdk; the
apache 2.0 license.  Much of the code here is not unique and can be found in
any of a dozen other projects, but the intent is for it to do one thing, and
do it well.  Enjoy.
